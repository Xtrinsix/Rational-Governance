## Government Operation

The creation and execution of rational public policy depends upon rational intentions by those who are in positions to create and execute such policy.

In order to move toward an environment supporting rational intentions, governments must be structured in a way that encourages competence, transparency and accountability, reduces and exposes abuse and corruption of power, and focuses politicians on the work of government as opposed to elections and retention of power.
