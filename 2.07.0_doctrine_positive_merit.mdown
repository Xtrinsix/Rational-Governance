## 2.7. Doctrine of Positive Merit

### 2.7.1. Summary
A political or social position is only valid if it has merits that can be asserted or defended through objective, rational argument without contrast or opposition to another policy, position, institution, group or individual.  Political and social authority are likewise valid only if earned through legitimate, unbiased means.  For political authority, this means aggressively fair and unbiased elections.  For social authority, this means displays of extrinsic behavior and qualities rather than intrinsic qualities such as gender, race and status of birth.
