## The Doctrine of Responsible Capitalism

Capitalism is the desired economic system for a free and open democracy, but capitalism can be easily corrupted and abused to benefit a few at the expense of others.  People must have trust that the economic system works for everyone, not just those in positions of power or authority.  The economy must not drive public policy.  Instead, good public policy with a focus on social responsibility will create the conditions that allow the economy to thrive and will maintain or restore trust in public institutions.
