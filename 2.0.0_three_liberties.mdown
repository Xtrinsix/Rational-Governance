## 2.0. The Three Liberties

### 2.0.1. Justification
Humanity extends beyond the concerns of an individual life.  Humans aggregate into persistent, organized regional groups that function as a unit, grow organically, take on personalities, strengths and weaknesses that reflect the individual members of the groups.  Global civilization is a reflection of humanity as a whole and is greater than the sum of its parts.  Despite the power and importance of global civilization and regional groups, an individual human life is more than just a node in a system, and the rights of the individual should be defended as fiercely as the preservation of civilization.  

Public policy should strive to find a balance between what is good for the individual versus what is good for civilization.  Neither can exist without the other, and both should be protected as precious and irreplaceable.  This section concerns itself with the rights associated with each of the aspects of humanity: individual, regional groups and global human civilization. 

### 2.0.2. Resolution of conflicts

Given three types of liberty and the potential for overlap of concerns, the resolution of conflicts should be handled accordingly.  Some rights may be restored if they are temporary violated.  Others may never be restored once lost.  Those that are permanently lost must take precedence over those that are transient.  Of those that may be permanently lost, global concerns must outweigh individual concerns, with regional concerns considered last.  This suggests the following order:

2.3.2.1. and 2.3.2.2. must supersede all other rights, as the preservation of global civilization as a whole is the ultimate concern.  
2.1.2.1., 2.1.2.8., 2.1.2.7. and 2.1.2.3 must follow in that order, although varying degrees of 2.1.2.7. and 2.1.2.8. may dictate that one might take precedence over the other. 
The remaining rights of global and individual liberty come next, in no particular order within those groups, but with global liberty taking precedence.
Finally, regional concerns are considered, generally in the order in which they are codified.

Furthermore, the rights of the individual must be protected except where the exercise of a right would violate the liberty of others.  For example, the right to free expression does not extend to the point where such expression would cause bodily harm or duress to another individual.
