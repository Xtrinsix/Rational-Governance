It is impossible to expect that all members of an inclusive society will practice the same religion, or that all members will practice any religion at all.  

Policy must not target any religion or faith.
Policy must not encourage or give advantage to any religion or faith.
Policy allowing special consideration for religious customs must be flexible enough to allow for any recognized religion.
In order to receive special considerations from an employer or other association for religious customs, it is fair to require a declaration of belief in the religion.  It is also fair that this declaration cannot be changed more than once per year.
