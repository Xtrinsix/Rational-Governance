### The Role of Government

#### Summary

Rational Governance recognizes that government is a tool for protecting and organizing public resources, protecting access to private resources, and ensuring that individuals adhere to a code of conduct that is deemed beneficial to society.  Government should not be a goal unto itself.   Government entities and politicians must be accountable to the people governed, and the checks against government must be protected and reaffirmed by each incoming administration.


#### Policy Challenges

###### Government Scope
Democracies, in particular, face the challenge of undefined government scope.  Competing ideologies in the form of political parties move in and out of power, each bringing its own vision of the role and scope of government.  Fluctuations in ideology and the policies created from them create inefficiencies as we have cycles of one party dismantling the work of the other party.
