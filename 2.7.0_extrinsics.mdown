## Extrinsics

### Intrinsic and extrinsic properties
Rational and fair public policy must ignore the intrinsic properties of an individual.  Every person has intrinsic properties that include genetics, circumstances of birth, race, age, gender, sexuality and belief.  These properties are assumed to be acquired without the control or consent of the individual, including some properties acquired during childhood before the person is capable of making rational independent decisions.  For the sake of the discussion of policy, intrinsic properties must also include any physical or mental afflictions forced upon an individual against the will of the individual.

By contrast, extrinsic properties reflect the rational and independent choices made by an individual, starting with the age at which a child begins to transition into an adult.  Permanent marks or other physical modifications, consequences of decisions, public actions, and violations of the rights of others are examples of extrinsic properties.  This is by no means a comprehensive list.  Rational and independent in this context does not forgive or excuse actions performed as a member of a group or in a moment when emotion interferes with rational thought.

All humans should be accorded the rights of Personal Liberty regardless of intrinsic properties.  Only extrinsic properties are cause for forfeiture of these rights.
It is fair and rational to place value judgements on extrinsic properties
