###### Summary

```

Each topic of policy begins with an introduction.  This is a required section for any topic of policy.  This serves as a summary and a brief justification for the topic.  Some persuasive language may be used in the justification of the topic, but no partisan or other irrational language may be used.

###### Policy Challenges

Represented in markdown as such: 

```markdown
#### 3.X.2. Policy Challenges
```

This section is optional.  This section enumerates the challenges involved in creating rational policy for the topic at hand.  Many topics of public policy are influenced by emotion or misunderstanding.  These common challenges need to be listed and then specifically addressed in the policy recommendations.  Each sub topic in the policy challenges should have a reference to the policy recommendation that addresses it.

Policy challenges may be a simple list represented in markdown as such:

```markdown

```

References to other sections should be referenced with ยง and the section number.

Additional background and informative text may be interspersed among the list items.
