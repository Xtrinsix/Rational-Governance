## The 20 Year Doctrine
Public policy must treat known global issues as if we have a 20 year horizon for solving them.  Common goals lead to bursts of economic activity and advancements in technology.  The nations of the world also need to learn to work together and citizens within the nations need to learn to stop fighting amongst themselves over trivial issues.  At any moment, humanity may discover an undeniable, imminent threat with a 20 year countdown, and we as a global community need to know that we can set aside petty differences and unify to meet the threat.
