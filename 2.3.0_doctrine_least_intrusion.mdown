## The Doctrine of Least Intrusion
When presented with multiple approaches to solving a problem through public policy, the least intrusive solution should be sought and implemented, and existing liberties must take priority.




[Public matters remain public.  Private matters remain private.  Policy without factual justification has no place in a rational society.  Given any conflicts or ambiguity, existing liberties must take priority.  Where ambiguity is found, definitions must be adopted in order to move forward.]
