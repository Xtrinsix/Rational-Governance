## Doctrine of Rational Integrity 
Public policy must not be driven by sentimental or irrational concerns; fear, disgust, sadness, and other negative sentiments and emotions lead to bad policy decisions.  Public policy must be created by or with approval from subject matter experts with training and knowledge on the subject of the legislation.  Individual pieces of legislation must be considered within the scope of broader policy to ensure a coherent overall system.
